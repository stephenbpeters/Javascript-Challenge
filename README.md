# Javascript-Challenge
Data Analytics Bootcamp Spring 2021

This is a javascript project to demonstrate reading JSON data, displaying it to a web page, and providing an interface for the web visitor to filter results.

There are two directories here:
* UFO-Level-1: index.html provides an interface for the visitor to filter UFO sighting records by date.
* UFO-Level-2: index.html adds several other filtering options for the same data.

At this time these scripts do not have any form validation or error checking.
